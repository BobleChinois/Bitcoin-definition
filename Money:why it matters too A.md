# Government control over money : why it matters more than you think
## Introduction
I think The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous will be a milestone in the slow realization of what Bitcoin is, digital sound money, and why it is at least a subversion of the current monetary system, or more likely a revolution in the monetary realm.
Saifedean mentions the historical study of hyperinflation episodes by Hanke and Bushnell, and make his point that every one of them occured during the era of government paper-money, except for one in France, and that was "the inflation in France in 1795, in the wake of the Mississippi Bubble, which was also produced through government money and engineered by the honorary father of modern government money, John Law."
In fact, this sentence confuses two distinct experiences of paper money in France, the first being the Mississippi Bubble that was part of John Law's System that went bankrupt in 1720, the second being the dramatic fall of the _Assignats_, a note created by the French Revolutionary Government in the wake of the 1789 uprising, badly inflated and then demonetized in 1795.
Whether the mistake is on Hanke and Bushnell or Saifedean doesn't matter, what matters is that the two events are indeed connected, and both illustrates Saifedean's point that hyperinflation is the disease of government paper money.
I wanted to know more about these two very important events in french history, and started reading about it. Unfortunately, contrary to the 1795 _Assignat_, Law's _System_ is not very well documented, except for a book by former stateman Edgar Faure, which looks amazing but that I haven't found yet. 
I still managed to find electronic version of two articles by the very much forgotten now Alphonse Vuitry, who was a french politician of the late XIXth century and an historian. It was a gold mine of information not only about John Law and his system, but also about how Louis XIV, the late king of France, drowned the state in an ocean of debts that paved the way to John Law's then highly unusual _fiat money_.
It is frequently argued that paper money inflation is a better way to finance government expenditures and deficit because it is hardly noticeable by the public, at least if kept in _reasonnable_ rate of, say, about 2% a year. I thought that this small piece of history made a good argument to prove this point, but also that precisely because of that it is vital that free men never ever let this convenient tool in the hands of any government, be it our modern and apparently good-meaning democracy, because it makes a lot of abuse possible without the ruler being accountable. 
## Introduction : sunset of the "Sun King"
The kingdom of France inherited from the Middle Ages a solid tradition of local power and what we would call nowadays "subsidiarity". The King of France had to compose with many local counter-powers to his own authority and administration, principally the nobility and regional courts of Justice called "Parliament". At this time, many provinces and even towns still had their own privileges, in the sense of _privatae leges_, or _private laws_. Since the word privilege had been made a bad press later on, it will be probably more accurate to talk about _autonomy_ to describe the state of affair at this point of history.
Louis XIV was confronted from a very young age to those threats on his own personnal power. The most powerful lords of the kingdom raised up during his childhood, events known as the _Fronde_. That's maybe why he spent most of his reign suppressing traditional counter-powers and consolidating his absolute personnal power. 
He may not have been a ruler as absolut as he pretended, but as a matter of fact he was certainly more absolut than any ruler of France before him (and thereafter, except maybe for Napoleon I).
Even if he did a great PR job that allowed him to be remembered as the "Sun King", the last 25 years of his reign were almost ininterrupted wars and misery for France, deeply resented by the people. War has always been expensive, so how did he manage to find money to keep his armies fighting for almost 15 years against the rest of Europe ? 
## Interlude : the french monetary system of the XVIIIth century
By the time, France was on a bimetallic standard, meaning that money was gold and silver coins, and couldn't be printed out of thin air. 
But there's a twist : there was then a fictional unit of account, called _livre tournois_, which value was arbitrarily fixed in terms of weight and aloy of precious metals. The gold coins, _louis d'or_, and silver ones, _écu_, worthed more or less _livres_ at the King's will. This feature was obviously abused by the King to depreciate the currency in times of need, as we should see later. 
The _livre_ had divisionnary units : 
* the _sol_, or _sou_, worth 1/20th of 1 _livre_,
* the _denier_, worth 1/12th of the _sou_, and 1/240th of the _livre_.
## The debt by the end of Louis XIV's reign, or How bad it really was
On the last 26 years of his reign, the cumulated revenue of the State is estimated to be more than 1.3 billion _livres_ on taxation and other means. Cumulated expenses, on the other hand, were about £5 billions in the mean time. 
Those figures are huge : it is estimated that by 1689 the monetary stock of France was only about £500 millions ! 
By the time the King died in 1715, the total debt of the State was about £2.4 billions, from £84 millions in 1689. Net fiscal income was £69 millions in 1715, meaning that the whole debt was about 35 years of net income ! 
## How to finance war in the late XVIIth century
Even if he could somehow depreciate the _livre_, it was still impossible for the Sun King, as absolute he was, to print money out of thin air. Beside currency devaluation, the King had then to rely massively on blatant borrowing and taxation to finance most of his wars. 
Every one of these three means was abused beyond what would be imaginable in today democratic societies.
### Taxation
As the King coffers got heavily drained on the first years of war, the more straightforward way to fill them again was of course to raise existing taxes and invent new ones. 
But there was obvious shortcomings :
* the nobility and the clergymen didn't pay taxes
* heavier taxation was highly unpopular
As for the first point, Louis XIV created new taxes that were paid by everyone, including the privileged ones :
* The _capitation_, meaning a tax _by head_. It is very similar to a flat tax of 15% on every revenue ;
* The _dixième_, meaning _one tenth_. This one is also pretty straightforward, the King was taking 10% of everyone's revenue (on top of every other taxes of course)
An interesting feature of the monarchy tax system is the _fermage_ system, meaning that most of the time taxes weren't levied directly by the King's administrators, but by rich people who gave the expedcted amount of tax money to the King, and then go and get the money themselves. Of course, they wanted their money back with a little profit, and for that were universally despised and hated by the people.
Because taxes are highly impopular, the King sometimes had to renounce them in case of emergency, for exemple when people went starving in 1709. 
### Money manipulation

### Borrowing
## Conclusion
I don't doubt that many of those that believe that it's okay for a government to finance itself through inflation will disregard the story of Louis XIV as irrelevant to our time.
