# Government control over money : why it matters more than you think
## Introduction
(Récupérer l'intro dans Evernote. Pourquoi parler des événements en France au XVIII. Saifedean, Hayek)
Louis XIV, king of France, and his reign is a good example why monetary policy definitely his the most powerful tool in the hand of a despot.
## Introduction : chaos on the sunset of the "Sun King"
The kingdom of France inherited from the Middle Ages a solid tradition of local power and what we would call nowadays "subsidiarity". The King of France had to compose with many counter-powers, principally the nobelty and regional courts of Justice called "Parliament" (not be confused with parliaments in modern democracy). Many provinces and even towns still had their own privileges, in the sense of _privatae leges_, or _private laws_. 
Louis XIV was confronted from a very young age to those threats on his own personnal power, with the insurrection of the most powerful lords of the kingdom during his childhood known as the _Fronde_. That's maybe why he spent most of his reign suppressing traditional counter-powers and consolidating his absolute personnal power. 
He may not have been a ruler as absolut as he pretended, but as a matter of fact he was certainly more powerful than any ruler of France before him (and thereafter, except maybe for Napoleon I).
Even if he did a great PR job that allowed him to be remembered as the "Sun King", the last 25 years of his reign were almost ininterrupted wars and misery for France. 
But war is expensive, and money ran out really fast. How to finance war then ?
## The debt by the end of Louis XIV's reign, or How bad it really was
On the last 26 years of his reign, it is estimated that Louis raised more than 1.3 billion _livres_ on taxation and other means, but expended about £5 billions in the mean time. 
These figures are huge : it is estimated that by 1689 the monetary stock of France was about £500 millions. 
By the time the King died in 1715, the total debt of the State was about £2.4 billions, whose about a half was redeemable immediately. Net fiscal income was about £69 millions, meaning that the whole debt was about 35 years of net income ! 
But how do we get there in the first place ?
## Interlude : the french monetary system of the XVIIIth century
By the time, France was on a bimetallic standard, meaning that money was gold and silver coins, and couldn't be printed out of thin air. 
But there's a twist : there was then a distinct unit of account, called _livre tournois_, which value was arbitrarily fixed in terms of weight and aloy of precious metals. The gold coins, _louis d'or_, and silver ones, _écu_, worthed more or less _livres_ at the King's will. This was obviously abused by the King to depreciate the currency in times of need, as we should see later. 
The _livre_ had divisionnary units : 
* the _sol_, or _sou_, 1 _livre_ worthing 20 of them,
* the _denier_, worth 1/12th of the _sou_, and 1/240th of the _livre_. 
## How to finance war in the late XVIIth century
As it should be self evident from this considerations, even if he had some means to depreciate the _livre_, as absolut as he can be, it was still impossible for the Sun King to print money out of thin air. 
Beside the good ol' currency devaluation, the King had to rely massively on blatant borrowing and taxation to finance most of his last wars. Interestingly, every one of these three means was abused beyond what would be imaginable in today democratic societies.
