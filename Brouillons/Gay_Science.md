# The Hodler's Gay Science,
## or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Crash

_Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severelyâ€”a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience._

With the recent crash, Bitcoin naysayers feel confident again and display a cocky "told you so" attitude. It would be almost intimidating if they had not already told the same story and been proven wrong dozens of times over the last decade. 

If you look at social media now, you would the feeling it's all tears and blood out there, and that would not be true, because a lot of us keep silent and didn't even know when the price freefalled, nor did they really care when they finally noticed. 

Why? Are they stupid or maybe oblivious? How can they keep so calm, and seem so out of reach of everything while you are freaking out? Could it be that they understand something that you don't?

I have been contemplating for some time now to write a short piece about why I'm interested in Bitcoin, and what make me incredibly confident about it. I think today is a good moment to reflect about this, as are finally falling apart the illusions that are called "blockchain" and "crypto", hailed by all experts and very intelligent people as the "next big thing", but really were nothing more than good old-fashioned asset price bubble (and insignificant ones with that). 

### Bitcoin, not blockchain

Let's face it: blockchain have been a huge joke played on banks, insurance companies, central banks and even some states to make a quick buck out of their gullibility. 

### Opening up of a new territory (discovery more than invention)

cf Bitcoin et bitcoins

It feels trivial to say in 2018 that the internet has durably modified the way information is shared, with far-reaching political, social and economic consequences. Litterally everybody says that. 

In my opinion, this is quite exagerated: the internet has indeed profundly changed some businesses, the most famous example being the music industry, and has somewhat modified the way we communicate, but its impact on the way we think and organize seems overrated at best, negative at worst. 

Youtube has replaced TV, to what avail? Most content that is consumed today is even more stupid than what we got on TV 20 years ago. People threw away their TV and stopped buying newspapers but get pretty much the same shit on their timeline. After some years of trials and errors, the old institutions have pretty much worked their way through this new communication paradigm and are objectively not that much threathened by it, while most people have merely adapted the way they consume entertainment that are as mindless as before.

Internet had and still has a huge potential for freeing the flow of information on a worldwide scale, with absolutely unimaginable consequences. We still get to see this potential sometimes, more and more on its fringes unfortunately, and those sudden glimpses of freedom get suppressed faster and faster. 

Internet is hailed for making information free, but we should ask ourselves if it didn't make it also worthless. It created an unlimited empty space for undetermined pieces of information to flow around, a chaos that Bitcoin shapes and orders for its own purpose.

Bitcoin most groundbreaking discovery is that we can actually shape data to produce an object that is virtual, yet shares the proprieties of physical objects that make them valuable economic goods: scarcity and rivalry. While opponents are discarding bitcoins for being "no things" having no connection whatsoever with anything in our physical world, and proponents tries to find what roots bitcoins value in our world (energy consumption for example), could it be that bitcoins are valuable _precisely_ because it is data that is _absolutely meaningless_ outside of its own world? I think so.

Yet it is common objection nowadays that since it is trivial to create new cryptocurrencies or even simply forks of Bitcoin, it could not be scarce. The argument can easily be refuted with an analogy to the way fiat money works: would ever someone in his right mind argues that by printing more of its own dollars the Zimbabweian central bank did debase the US dollar? This makes intuitively little sense, and should be enough to convince most people.

But I think we can make a more interesting objection. In fact, if you don't own nor use any bitcoin or bitcoin's fork or shitcoin, it is somewhat true that bitcoins are not scarce, as you could potentially use any of them, you just don't make any difference. But as soon as you choose to commit to one of these mutually exclusive networks, you cut yourself out of any possibility of exchange with someone on another network. I own and use bitcoins, hence bitcoins are scarce and there will never be more than 21m, since I will never be able to exchange with people that owns Bitcoin SV, thank god!

### Revolution, or refoundation?

Not a technological revolution, but an institutionnal, political and cultural attempt at refoundation (challenging two hundred years or so of a slow movement toward hegemony of the state)

We identified the "technological revolution" narrative that is blockchain and I hope to have convinced you this is utter bullshit, so what kind of revolution would Bitcoin be? I think it is in fact more a counter-revolution than a revolution, a counter-revolution of the individuals against the collective bodies and powers that attempt to encroach on their freedom. 

### The only fight that is worth picking up today

_Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds require time even after they are done, before they can be seen and heard._

We already heard a lot, and have been hearing even more recently that "crypto \[or the only one that ever matter, Bitcoin\] don't solve any real-world problem ; it's just a weird experiment for nerds and libertarians". 

On the contrary, I would argue that Bitcoin does solve real-world problem. It is an attempt to solve pretty much the only problems we should ever need to care of. It will just take some time to, because we're not talking about consumers' dissatisfaction here, you don't do this kind of revolution overnight. 

Of course, you will get my point only if you consider that:
* State of endless wars abroad and emergency at home
* Infinite growth of the gov and it taking forever more decisions on your behalf for everything in your life
* rewarding irresponsible behaviour, pettiness, frivolity and submission and seeking to punish hard work, savings, prudence and freedom
* People feeling desperate, being poorer and in debt

...are even problems in the first place. If not, then you are probably a journalist or a politician, and you have no reason to have any interest whatsoever in Bitcoin, and I won't blame you for that. Just ignore it and you'll be fine for some more time, probably.

If you feel that any or all of the point above is not right, doesn't have to be this way and if you want to make a difference, then investing your time and energy in learning, thinking, trying and finally hodling bitcoins for you or the people you care about is the best course of action you can possibly take here and now. 

Bitcoin is the eventuality of the more radical revolution Humanity ever witnessed. It is even more staggering when one thinks that it is also probably the first and only absolutely non-violent revolution that will ever exist.
