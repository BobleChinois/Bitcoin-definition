# A Hodler's Gay Science,
## or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bear Market

_Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely—a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience._

With the recent crash, Bitcoin naysayers feel confident again and display a cocky "told you so" attitude. It would be almost intimidating if they had not already been telling the same story [dozens of times over the last decade](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/) and consistently proven wrong. 

But even if the bears are all out these days, fact is there are many of us that keep silent and didn't even know when the price freefalled, nor did they care when they finally noticed shitcoins traders capitulating on social media. 

Why? Are we stupid or oblivious? How can we keep so calm, and seem so out of reach of everything? Could it be that we know something that you don't?

I have been contemplating for some time now to write a short piece about why I'm interested in Bitcoin, and what makes me incredibly confident about it. While the illusion that is called "blockchain" and "crypto" and hailed by all experts and very intelligent people as the "next big thing" is finally falling apart as we celebrate today the first 10 years of Bitcoin, I feel now is the time to try to figure out why for me Bitcoin is indeed different. 

Oh, and don't think too much about the title, I'm not especially found of Nietzsche either, I just think it sounds cool.

### Bitcoin, not blockchain

_Better an enmity from one block
than friendship held together by glue_

"Blockchain" has been a huge joke played on banks, insurance companies, central bankers and even some states to make a quick buck out of their gullibility. How did they fall for that? Mostly because they have been trained like the proverbial Pavlov's dog to throw money at every "technological innovation" that is sold to them every few years by consultants, as an expiation for consistently failing to solve the real technological inefficiencies that bloat their own business. 

At the end of the day, "Blockchain" was just another old-fashioned asset bubble, that like every other bubbles has pretty much nothing to do with the asset whose price is inflated, and everything with the belief that some asset [has to be inflated to grow an economy](https://mises.org/library/krugmans-call-housing-bubble).

On another level, there has been a collective failure to look at things with a skeptical eye rather than that of a superstitious cargo cult believer. Because if you do that, 5 minutes are more than enough to realize "blockchain" will not solve any problem of yours. 

A "blockchain" [isn't even a thing](https://medium.com/s/story/blockchain-is-a-semantic-wasteland-9450b6e5012) in the first place, Satoshi never mentioned it, while the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings (and ex-JPMorgan) Blythe Masters seems to be widely credited for coining the concept and igniting the whole movement. 

Oh, she just [stepped down](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-19/blythe-masters-marks-the-end-of-the-blockchain-bubble?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid%253D=socialflow-twitter-view&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=view&utm_medium=social) in case you didn't know. I guess she felt the wind turned recently.

What is the problem Bitcoin solves? In a nutshell, it conciles three features that were thought to be incompatible in a money: digital, double-spend resistant and without a central authority. 

What is called the "blockchain" in Bitcoin is merely a part of what makes this possible. Here is an attempt at breaking up what "a chain of blocks" is really needed for:
* blocks have number, and their order creates its own temporality, which is a lot better than having to rely on some kind of time-stamping to tell wich transaction is earlier. If Tx1 is included in block #1, then you can tell with absolute certitude that it was earlier than any other transactions written down in following blocks.
* without blocks it would be much harder, probably impossible, to implement the Proof-of-Work, the miner's reward, and the mining difficulty adjustement algorithm, which are all vital component in Bitcoin.
* It is likely that the cryptography used to link transactions and blocks together makes validation by full node a lot easier and less computer-intensive, or even possible at all.

As a thought experiment, we could imagine a Bitcoin without blocks. Transactions could still be linked together pretty much the same than today, but it means that every node would need to be there from the beginning without ever going offline, or else how could they catch up? It would be very easy to feed them false transactions that supposedly occured while they weren't there. Worse, even without going offline, if thousands of nodes suddenly appear with a different transactions history, as a "honnest" node how can you be sure they don't have the right version? Such a network would be very vulnerable to all kind of attacks, and most likely rapidly divides and falls apart without a central validator. 

With Bitcoin's blockchain:
* you have a strong proof that every transaction that ever occured is coherent with the whole history as you know it,
* you can easily check for the cumulated proof-of-work that gives you the "heaviest" chain (the one which consumed the most work to forge), which you have to assume to be the valid one,
* you can trace every transaction back to a miner reward, 
* last but not least, the difficulty adjustement makes sure that stock-to-flow ratio is as constant as possible (ie. that the supply of bitcoins is constant regardless of the evolution of demand).

A "chain of blocks" is merely the way Bitcoin is organising its transaction history to allow for some other more important features like those I mentioned. It it useful in Bitcoin, but doesn't make a lot of sense when it is isolated from the global Bitcoin architecture to serve other goals. 

By the way, as a new year resolution, I decided to not use the term "blockchain" when talking about Bitcoin anymore (except when talking about obvious blockchain bullshit) as it is corrupted beyond redemption, and replace it when possible by more descriptive alternatives like "chain of blocks" or "timechain". 

### Opening up of a new territory

_For believe me! — the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is: to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves! Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you seekers of knowledge! _

In my opinion, Bitcoin most groundbreaking yet somewhat underrated discovery is that we can actually shape data to produce an object that is virtual but still shares the properties of physical objects that make them valuable economic goods: scarcity and rivalry. 

Opponents disregards this fact when they argued that bitcoins are worthless because they are purely digital things. They are right because data being infinitely replicable cheaply in the digital age is indeed worthless, but they fail to see that Bitcoin is precisely an attempt at making digital scarcity, and that it has been tremendously successful at it so far. 

A subset of this objection is that since Bitcoin can be forked or copied easily to spin up new "cryptocurrencies", it is not scarce, quite the contrary it is even highly inflatable by anyone. There is some merit to this objection, since it is right as long as it concerns altcoins, whose business model is mostly to convince you that they are the next Bitcoin and compete to have the best narrative to do so, making them effective "airdrop money". Both the great altcoin mania of 2013 and the ICO craze of 2017 tell the same story. 

It is no wonder this argument appeals mostly to nocoiners though, since it obviously falls apart as soon as you really use Bitcoin, for no Bitcoin hodler in his right mind would ever accept BCH or BSV tokens as a payment, like you certainly won't accept [zimbabwean dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar) instead of American ones. No one would ever argue that Zimbabwe inflating its own currency was also inflating the US dollar, and BCH or BSV supplies are in the same way irrelevant to the quantity of bitcoins in circulation. 

Proponents have sometimes made a similar error when they tried to figure out how bitcoins' value is rooted in the physical world, to energy consumed by mining for example. Trying to reduce Bitcoin digital scarcity to physical scarcity is another way to miss the point that bitcoins are valuable _precisely_ because they are made of data that is _absolutely meaningless_ outside of its own world.

It should be clear by now that Bitcoin is not a company or a normal software project. While the technology still evolves and requires some degree of organisation and decision making, it has a life on its own and is valuable only as it is largely out of reach of politics. As far as I'm concerned, the most useful analogy I could think of would be to consider Bitcoin as a newly discovered way to transform data _itself_ into something valuable for us humans, pretty much like it takes the invention of the internal combustion engine to turn some worthless mineral oil into a strategic resource like petrol.

### Revolution, or refoundation?

_My conception of freedom. - The value of a thing sometimes does not lie in that which one attains by it, but in what one pays for it - what it costs us._

Now that you're finally convinced the "technological revolution" narrative that is blockchain is utter bullshit, you should ask yourself what kind of revolution is Bitcoin? Or is it a revolution at all? 

I think it is in fact more a counter-revolution than a revolution, a counter-revolution of the individuals against the collective bodies and powers that have been encroaching on their freedom for the past century or so. 

It feels trivial to say in 2018 that the internet has durably modified the way information is shared, with far-reaching political, social and economic consequences. Litterally everybody says that. 

In my opinion, this is quite exagerated: the internet has indeed profundly changed some businesses, the most famous example being the music industry, and has somewhat modified the way we communicate, but its impact on the way we think and organize seems overrated to me. 

Youtube has replaced TV, to what avail? Most content that is consumed today is even more stupid than what we got on TV 20 years ago. People threw away their TV and newspapers but get the same shit on their timeline, what a deal!

Despite (debatable) epiphenomenes like Brexit or Trump, the old institutions have pretty much worked their way out of this new communication paradigm and don't seem to be really threaten by it anymore. While information that should sparlke widespread indignation and unrest has never been more easily available than today, while it has never been easier and cheaper for literally anyone to reach a world-wide audience with a message and almost all useful knowledge is readily accessible for free, yet people have never seemed less willing to challenge the power that be. Why is that?

I'm convinced that the missing piece to understand that is the fact that we've been living in the age of "easy money". Because of that most people already forgot that we live in a world of scarcity, that humans have to constantly cooperate to fight against in order to achieve some measure of material well-being. Money is the backbone of economic organisation, since it allows us to evaluate what economic activity is more efficient, and make it possible to proportionate previous actions outputs (money earned) to future consumption and investment.

To have the power to spend money without earning it is the power to decide how other's ressources will be consumed and/or invested without having to give something first. It allows those that "create" money to decide scarce ressources allocation and never have to pay the price for it, since it is literally "free money" to them. It is not only the recipe for economic inefficiency and waste, but also highly immoral as argued by Hülsmann in [The Ethics of Money Production](https://mises.org/library/ethics-money-production).

We have been living in a world where governments have hold this power for decades, allowing it to finance pretty much any policy that fits in the beliefs or interests of those in power while buying social peace and allegeance from more and more people that depend on government to make a living, either because they are employed by it or rely on welfare state. A significant part of the population in most western democracies live more or less directly off government spending money it doesn't have, and they all have strong incentives to keep the statu quo, no matter what it takes. 

People won't make things change, regardless of internet making information free and highly available, because people don't bite the hand that feed. This won't change until it loses the power to create money, either because it abuses it so much that the whole system implodes (it is doomed to end like this, but it can take some time), or there's an alternative that allows more and more people to store and exchange value out of reach of the legacy banking system, creating strong incentives to strive outside of the government controlled economy. 

Bitcoin is the missing link that will fulfill the expectations we had about internet as a vector for a "revolution".

### The only fight that is worth picking up today

_Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds require time even after they are done, before they can be seen and heard._

We already heard a lot, and have been hearing even more recently that "crypto (meaning here the only one that ever matters, Bitcoin) doesn't solve any real-world problem ; it's just a weird experiment for nerds and libertarians". 

On the contrary, I would argue that Bitcoin gives a very serious shot at solving some real-world problems. It is an attempt to solve pretty much the only problems we should ever need to care of. It will just take some time to, because we're not talking about the last petty technological gadget here, you don't do this kind of revolution overnight. 

Of course, to get my point you have to consider that:
* State of endless wars abroad and emergency at home
* Infinite growth of the government and it taking more and more decisions on your behalf regarding your own life
* Rewarding irresponsible behaviour, pettiness, frivolity and submission while punishing hard work, saving, prudence and freedom
* People being ever more desperate, poorer and indebted, without being able to tell how they got into this mess

...are even problems in the first place. If not, then you are probably a journalist or a politician, and you have no reason to have any interest whatsoever in Bitcoin, and I won't blame you for that. Just keep ignoring it and you'll be fine for some more time. If you're old enough, you might even hope to get away with it.

On the contrary, if you know or even confusely feel that any or all of the points above are wrong, that things don't have to be this way and if you want to make a difference, then investing your time and energy in learning, thinking, trying and finally hodling bitcoins for you and the people you care about is the best course of action you can possibly take here and now. 

Bitcoin is the eventuality of the more radical revolution Humanity ever witnessed. It is even more staggering when you think that it is also probably the most radical, yet the only absolutely non-violent revolution that will ever exist. That's where you want to stand if you're looking for something that worth fighting for here and now.
