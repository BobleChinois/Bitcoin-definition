# Should we worry about deflation in a Bitcoin standard ?

A very interesting debate occurs last week between George Selgin and Saifedean Ammous about the concrete management of a deflation economy in case Bitcoin becomes the world's monetary standard. Juice [sums up the points made by the two sides in a more convenient fashion than the original twitter thread](https://medium.com/@rextar4444/the-nashian-re-solution-to-saifedeans-bitcoin-standard-and-george-selgin-s-complaint-for-an-588ba758c3d2) and adds some context about fractional reserve banking. He also states in his own view how Nash can reconciliate Selgin and Ammous' views.

This made an excellent excuse for me to read some of Selgin's work, which I have been contemplating for some time now. As he mentionned himself his book [_Less than zero: The Case for a Falling Price Level in a Growing Economy_](https://mises.org/library/less-zero-case-falling-price-level-growing-economy-0) as a must-read to understand what he means in his debate with Saifedean, I read it first to have a balanced view as I'm already more familiar with Saifedean's arguments.

I tried to figure things out and see if we should really worry about this kind of deflation, and what we can do about it.

## Context
In _Less than zero_, published in 1997, G. Selgin doesn't contemplate some kind of _table rase_, but considers that as Central Banks' monetary policies shifted from overtly inflationnist in the 70's to targeting "zero" or near-zero inflation in the 90's, the case for not only zero but _negative_ inflation, or _deflation_, to follow productivity rate of growth, should be considered as a next step. He tries to make a pragmatic arguments and doesn't assume fundamental changes to the way things work in the current system. 

On the other hand, Saifedean in _The Bitcoin Standard_ advocates a telluric shift in the functioning of the global monetary system. Instead of the current _fiat_ system in which the US Dollar serves as the world reserve currency, he imagines a Bitcoin standard quite similar to the old Gold standard in some aspects, with bitcoins being the reserve currency used between Central Banks for settlement, and issuance of tokens or other money-substitutes (ie. that have a fixed value in bitcoins and are maybe redeemable in it) for everyday transactions. 

G. Selgin answered to [a review of Saifedean's book](https://reason.com/archives/2018/07/22/bitcoin-standard-ammous-blockchain-gold#comment), which quoted him doubting that the fixed, "hard-cap" supply of bitcoins makes it unsuitable for a monetary standard. Let's see what it means by looking directly at _Less than zero_.

## Selgin's argument for a _productivity norm_
Selgin makes very clear that his point is to consider the respective merits of two kind of inflation targeting that could be pursued by Central Banks : 
1. The "Zero inflation" target : Central Banks controls monetary base (ie. quantity of monetary units in circulation) so that the aggregate of output prices remains constant.
2. The "productivity norm" target : while Central Banks still conter variations in output prices provoked either by a change in the velocity of money (people spend more or less for various reason) or by a "supply shock" (unexpected variation in the supply of one or many materials that drives the price of productive input up), BUT not if output prices' changes are a consequence of productivity gains.

To put things another way, there are 3 factors that can modify output prices according to Selgin :
1. velocity of money
2. supply of productive factors
3. productivity

If aiming at zero inflation, a Central Bank needs to counteracts any change in these 3 factors. With a productivity norm, it only needs to care about the 2 first, and let the prices fluctuates freely with change in productivity. Except for catastrophic events like war, productivity is steadily rising every year, meaning that _all things being equal_ prices should also steadily deflate. 

### Examples
Let's suppose an economy that produces 100 different outputs. Due to increase of productivity, the supply for one of them (let's call it "oil") increase, driving its price down. What will happen ?
1. If Central Banks target zero inflation, it would have to expand the monetary base in the proportion of the expected impact of the price of oil on the price index, stimulating aggregate demand (the global demand for any good), so that the price index stay constant. Oil price still falls, but less than it would have otherwise, while the price of the others 99 goods and every input involved in their production increase slightly.
2. In the productivity norm scenario, as long as decrease in the price of oil is due to productivity improvement, it doesn't need any intervention from the Central Bank. Oil price will decrease, and the whole price index will also _slightly_ decrease. 

### What about wages ?
If we remember the original tweet, Selgin was concerned that workers might not readily accept that their nominal revenue shrink, even if their _real_ revenue is increasing (nominal prices are falling faster than nominal revenue). If I understood it well, the main problem here is psychological, as people would notice a fall in their wages far before they notice any price's fall. There is a very simple problem of perception here : maybe we are in fact all better off, but individuals don't have a global understanding of what's going on and might perceive that they are worst off because their nominal revenue is less than a year before. 

In his book, Selgin indeed discuss at lenght this issue. He makes the proposal to target price index through nominal revenue, or wages. It's not the place to discuss this at lenght, but what is relevant for our subject is indeed that his proposal should makes nominal wages stagnate or slightly increase, not _deflating_ with prices.

### Free banking
Selgin thinks that his proposal of free banking will makes this scheme possible. The main caracteristics of the banking system he advocates are :
* Central Banks are still around, with the mission to stabilise prices according to the "productivity norm".
* Commercial banks run on fractionary reserve, without any legal requirement.
* There is a reserve currency, created by the Central Banks and used exclusively in interbanking settlement, and commercial banks create their own supply of currency to be lend to the public.

He argues that the Central Bank only needs to inflate (or contract) the monetary base of the reserve currency to adjust nominal revenue to the variation of productivity it anticipated. As far as I can tell, Saifedean would not disagree with most of what is proposed here, except for two things :
* If the reserve currency is Bitcoin, then Central Banks can't inflate it at will like says US Dollar.
* Fractional reserve banking is fundamental for Selgin, while Saifedean, without absolutely ruling it out, still makes clear in his book that he doesn't believe it would be possible on a large scale with a Bitcoin standard, due to the transparency of blockchain transactions that should allow almost anyone to easily control that a bank is solvent. 

### Fractional reserve banking
Juice saw clearly that the possibility and desirability of fractional reserve banking is what is at stake here, so he defines what he means by it in his article. 

We discussed FRB on twitter sometimes ago, only to quickly find out that we don't agree on it being a "normal" part of the bank business, but as always it's more because that we weren't talking about the same thing.

Quoting wikipedia, he makes the point that "Fractional-reserve banking allows banks to act as financial intermediaries between borrowers and savers, and to provide longer-term loans to borrowers while providing immediate liquidity to depositors (providing the function of maturity transformation)". He justly points out that being against FRB would then mean being against bank loan, which would indeed be silly !

I don't agree with this, as it conflates deposit, which is money immediately available to the account holder and (most of the time) doesn't pay interest, and other kinds of account like time-deposit, that pay interests but are NOT available to the holder (or at least should not be available). 

You perfectly can lend money without FRB, as long as the deposit money pay interest to the holder and is not available to him before term. The point of FRB is that the same money is available to two or more different people at the same time, effectively creating money out of thin air. I don't agree that a deposit account is fundamentally different from a bailment from this point of view, I think you can't argue that the depositor lend money to the banks by making a deposit.

Anyway, I side with de Soto in his [_Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles_](https://mises.org/library/money-bank-credit-and-economic-cycles) on this matter. Maybe we could discuss it more at lenght another time.
